# CRUD Operations using EJS

This repository demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using EJS with Node.js and Express.

I built this project while learning how CRUD operations work in a backend application and how data flows between routes, middleware, models, and views. The main goal of this project was to understand request handling, form submissions, server-side rendering with EJS, and basic backend logic.

The application allows creating records, displaying them on pages, updating existing data, and deleting records using Express routes and EJS templates.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:
- Express routing
- Handling form data
- Using middleware
- Connecting backend logic with EJS views
- Structuring a simple Node.js project

This is a learning-focused project and represents my early backend development practice.
